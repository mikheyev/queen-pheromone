# Analyzing gene expression induced by queen pheromone in ants and bees

This project has two branches: [bioinformatics](blob/bioinformatics) and [stats](blob/stats). The former contains code run on OIST's Sango cluster, starting from raw reads. The latter contains R-based analyses run locally, and the Kallisto gene expression data.
