# Analyzing gene expression induced by queen pheromone in ants and bees

This project has two branches: [bioinformatics](../bioinformatics) and [stats](../stats). The former contains code run on OIST's Sango cluster, starting from raw reads. The latter contains R-based analyses run locally, and the Kallisto gene expression data.
