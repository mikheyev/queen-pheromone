# Analyzing gene expression induced by queen pheromone in ants and bees

This project has two branches: [bioinformatics](../bioinformatics/README.md) and [stats](../stats/README.md). The former contains code run on OIST's Sango cluster, starting from raw reads. The latter contains R-based analyses run locally, and the Kallisto gene expression data. A RMarkdown documtent with the code and main figures [is avaiable](https://mikheyev.github.io/queen-pheromone)
